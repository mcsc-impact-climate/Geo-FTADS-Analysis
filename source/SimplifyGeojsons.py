    ----------
    shapefiles: Dictionary containing paths to shapefiles in the data dir
    columns_keep: Dictionary containing lists of column names to keep for shapefiles in which we want to drop some columns
    coordinate: Int, optional
        DESCRIPTION. The default is 3857.
    tolerance: Int, optional
